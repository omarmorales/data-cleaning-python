# CLEANING DATA WITH PYTHON :snake:

This time I want to share some of the techniques that I've learned for data cleaning using Python.

I'll use data a dataset that contains the updated information (2019) of the victims of the crimes in the investigation folders of the Attorney General's Office (PGJ) of Mexico City.

## Libraries & Dependencies :books:
- [datos abiertos cdmx](https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/explore/dataset/victimas-en-carpetas-de-investigacion-pgj/table/): data related to mexico city
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
